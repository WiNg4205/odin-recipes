        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs. You can also substitute chicken 
            breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. If you use chicken or rib-eye, 
            you must add thinly sliced green onion tops. This can also be broiled in the 
            oven for the same amount of time.
        </p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/2 large onion, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
            <li>3 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken , cut 1/3- to 
                1/2-inch-thick across bones)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metallic bowl. 
                Whisk in onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar, and pepper, whisking until 
                sugars dissolve. Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 
                7 to 12 hours; the longer, the better.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Remove ribs from marinade and shake off excess; discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
